Enhanced `generateDynamicMessage` to handle all defined error codes with empathetic, actionable responses:

- **`PATIENT_NOT_FOUND`**: "I couldn't find your record. Could you verify your name and date of birth, or should I register you as a new patient?"
- **`APPOINTMENT_TYPE_NOT_FOUND`**: "I'm not sure what type of appointment you need. Could you describe it, or would you like me to list our services?"
- **`NO_AVAILABILITY`**: "I don't see any openings for that time. Would you like me to check another date?"
- **`NEXHEALTH_API_ERROR`**: "I'm having trouble with our scheduling system right now. Could we try again in a moment?"
- **`VALIDATION_ERROR`**: "I didn't quite catch that. Could you try saying it differently?"
- **And 15+ additional error codes with specific recovery guidance**

#### **2. Enhanced Fallback System**
