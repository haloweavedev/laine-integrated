## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### **Book Appointment Tool** (`lib/tools/bookAppointment.ts`)

**Schema:**
```typescript
{
  selectedTime: string,        // "8:00 AM" from user selection  
  patientId: string,          // From find_patient_in_ehr
  appointmentTypeId: string,  // From find_appointment_type
  requestedDate: string,      // "2025-12-23" format
  durationMinutes: number     // From find_appointment_type
}
```

**NexHealth API Payload:**
```javascript
{
  location_id: 318534,
  patient_id: 379724872,
  provider_id: 377851144,
  appointment_type_id: 997003,
  operatory_id: 159815,
  start_time: "2025-12-23T08:00:00-06:00",
  end_time: "2025-12-23T08:30:00-06:00", 
  source: "laine_ai",
  note: "General Cleanup - Scheduled via LAINE AI Assistant"
}
```

### **Time Parsing Logic**
- Converts patient input ("8:00 AM") to NexHealth format ("2025-12-23T08:00:00-06:00")
- Handles 12-hour to 24-hour conversion
- Calculates end_time using appointment duration
- Uses Central Time timezone (-06:00) to match NexHealth

### **Error Handling**
- **Authentication Errors**: Clear messaging for token issues
- **Slot Conflicts**: Handles time slot no longer available
- **Validation Errors**: User-friendly messages for invalid input
- **API Failures**: Graceful fallback to office contact

## 🧪 Testing & Verification

### **Scripts Created:**
1. `scripts/test-booking-tool.js` - Tests time parsing logic
2. `scripts/test-complete-booking-flow.js` - Verifies complete flow
3. `scripts/test-actual-booking.js` - Live API testing (with safety mode)

### **Test Results:**
- ✅ Time parsing: "8:00 AM" → "2025-12-23T08:00:00-06:00" 
- ✅ End time calculation: 30 min duration → "08:30:00"
- ✅ Booking payload structure matches NexHealth API requirements
- ✅ All tool data flows correctly between steps

## 🎯 Success Metrics

### **Before Implementation:**
- ❌ User: "Can I come in for a general cleanup on December 23?"
- ❌ System: "No slots available" (due to missing availability)

### **After Implementation:**
- ✅ User: "Can I come in for a general cleanup on December 23?"
- ✅ System: "Great! I have these times available: 8:00 AM, 8:30 AM, 9:00 AM..."
- ✅ User: "8:00 AM"
- ✅ System: "Perfect! I've successfully booked your General Cleanup for Tuesday, December 23, 2025 at 8:00 AM."
