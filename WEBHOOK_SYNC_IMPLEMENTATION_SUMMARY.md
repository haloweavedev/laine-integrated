# üîÑ Webhook Sync Implementation Summary

## üö® **Original Problem Analysis**

### Issue Identified
```
Jun 02 03:46:16.18
POST 401 
laine-integrated.vercel.app/api/nexhealth-webhook
Missing webhook signature
```

**Root Cause:** NexHealth webhooks were failing with 401 errors due to missing signatures, indicating webhook subscriptions were either:
- Not properly configured
- Out of sync with NexHealth
- Missing secret key verification

This prevented real-time data synchronization between NexHealth and LAINE.

### üîß **Production Issue Discovered & Fixed**
```
[AutoWebhookSync] Error: Command failed: pnpm webhook:subscribe xyz
/bin/sh: line 1: pnpm: command not found
```

**Issue:** Shell command execution failed in production environment (Vercel) because `pnpm` is not available in the PATH during API route execution.

**Solution:** Created `lib/webhook-utils.ts` with direct NexHealth API integration, eliminating shell command dependencies.

This prevented real-time data synchronization between NexHealth and LAINE.

## ‚úÖ **Solution Implemented**

### 1. **Automatic Webhook Synchronization**
- **When:** Every time practice configuration is saved
- **How:** Automatically runs `pnpm webhook:subscribe {subdomain}` script
- **Result:** Ensures webhooks are always up-to-date with latest practice settings

### 2. **Webhook Status Tracking**
- **New Field:** `webhookLastSyncAt` in Practice model
- **Purpose:** Track when webhooks were last synchronized
- **Display:** Shows last sync time in practice config UI

### 3. **Enhanced User Experience**
- **Success Feedback:** "Configuration saved and webhooks synchronized successfully!"
- **Warning Feedback:** Shows specific webhook sync issues if they occur
- **Visual Status:** Clear webhook status indicators in the UI

---

## üõ† **Technical Implementation**

### Files Modified

#### 1. **Database Schema** (`prisma/schema.prisma`)
```prisma
model Practice {
  // ... existing fields ...
  webhookLastSyncAt       DateTime?     // Last time webhooks were synchronized
}
```

#### 2. **Practice Config API** (`app/api/practice-config/basic/route.ts`)
- ‚úÖ Auto-sync webhooks after saving configuration
- ‚úÖ 30-second timeout for webhook operations
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive error handling and logging
- ‚úÖ Success/failure feedback to frontend

#### 3. **Webhook Sync API** (`app/api/practice-config/webhook-sync/route.ts`)
- ‚úÖ Dedicated endpoint for manual webhook sync
- ‚úÖ Runs existing webhook subscription script
- ‚úÖ Updates database timestamps
- ‚úÖ Returns detailed sync results

#### 4. **Practice Config UI** (`app/practice-config/page.tsx`)
- ‚úÖ Shows last webhook sync timestamp
- ‚úÖ Enhanced webhook status display
- ‚úÖ Auto-sync feedback messages
- ‚úÖ Clear guidance for webhook troubleshooting

## üéØ **Expected Benefits**

### Immediate Impact
1. **Zero 401 Webhook Errors** - Automatic sync prevents stale subscriptions
2. **Real-time Data Sync** - NexHealth updates flow seamlessly to LAINE
3. **Reduced Manual Work** - No more manual webhook subscription commands
4. **Clear Status Visibility** - Users know exactly when webhooks were last synced

### Long-term Impact
1. **Improved Reliability** - Webhooks stay synchronized with practice changes
2. **Better User Experience** - Transparent webhook status and automatic management
3. **Reduced Support Issues** - Self-healing webhook configuration
4. **Data Consistency** - Always up-to-date patient and appointment data

## üß™ **Testing Checklist**

### Before Production
- [ ] Save practice configuration and verify webhook auto-sync
- [ ] Check webhook status display shows correct timestamp
- [ ] Verify toast notifications show sync success/failure
- [ ] Test with valid NexHealth subdomain/location ID
- [ ] Test with invalid credentials (should fail gracefully)

### After Production Deployment
- [ ] Monitor `/api/nexhealth-webhook` for 401 errors (should be zero)
- [ ] Verify webhook subscriptions are active in NexHealth dashboard
- [ ] Test appointment creation in NexHealth ‚Üí LAINE receives webhook
- [ ] Verify patient updates in NexHealth ‚Üí LAINE receives webhook

---

## üîç **Monitoring & Troubleshooting**

### Success Indicators
- ‚úÖ Webhook status shows green checkmarks in UI
- ‚úÖ Last sync timestamp updates when configuration is saved
- ‚úÖ Zero 401 errors in webhook endpoint logs
- ‚úÖ Toast messages confirm successful sync

### Warning Signs
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Orange warning in webhook status section
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Old timestamp for last webhook sync
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Toast warnings about sync issues
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Continued 401 errors in logs

### Debug Steps
1. Check practice configuration is complete (subdomain + location ID)
2. Verify NexHealth credentials are correct
3. Check webhook subscription script output in logs
4. Ensure global webhook endpoint is configured

---

## üìã **Deployment Instructions**

### 1. Database Migration
```bash
pnpm db:push  # ‚úÖ Already completed
```

### 2. Deploy to Production
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: implement automatic webhook sync on practice config save"
git push origin main
```

### 3. Verify Deployment
1. Visit https://laine-integrated.vercel.app/practice-config
2. Save practice configuration
3. Verify webhook sync feedback appears
4. Check webhook status section shows recent sync time

---

## üí° **Architecture Insights**

### Why This Approach Works
1. **Proactive Sync** - Prevents issues before they occur
2. **User-Centric** - Sync happens when users make changes
3. **Transparent** - Clear feedback and status visibility
4. **Fault-Tolerant** - Handles failures gracefully
5. **Maintainable** - Uses existing webhook subscription script

### Future Enhancements
- [ ] Add webhook health check endpoint
- [ ] Implement automatic retry for failed syncs
- [ ] Add webhook event debugging dashboard
- [ ] Monitor webhook delivery success rates
